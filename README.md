# King County House Price Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression Methods

This project is mainly done to showcase applying simple linear regression methods 
on price prediction.

I have only done this analysis as a final project for STAT-615 regression course
and in no way I recommend using these methods on datasets that can benefit from 
different algorithms such as random forests or boosting methods. 

That's why at the end of the project I run a simple random forest using H2o 
without any data optimization and feature engineering achieving a similar score to 
final regression score.
